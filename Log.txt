.LOG
My update file, which will help me with consistent commits!
Sometimes, I don't have much to write, but my batch file definitely has something to say:

"updated 2022-01-13 14:58:30.82" "updated 2022-01-16 18:04:36.49" 
"updated 2022-01-17 12:13:34.29" 
"updated 2022-01-18 13:23:37.34" 

14:52 2022-01-18
File has been converted into a log file. Batch file updated to accommodate format change, specifically the timestamp.

14:54 2022-01-18
Tested the batch file. Success.
