My update file, which will help me with consistent commits!
Sometimes, I don't have much to write, but my batch file definitely has something to say:

"updated 2022-01-13 14:58:30.82" 
"updated 2022-01-16 18:04:36.49" 
"updated 2022-01-17 12:13:34.29"

New idea for browser extension: A speed-clicker bot. 
User assigns a key to activate/kill the clicker. 
Then, when the key is triggered, the mouse will begin repeatedly clicking at a speed determined by user (on a slider?)
